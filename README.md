# node.js_rest_api
Hi everyone, This is Hafiz Sohaib and welcome to my GitHub profile.

I created a Basic REST API Project in Node.js and SqLite3.

To run this project. First, clone or download this project and go to main folder. Then run following commands

1) npm i (To Install All Node Modules)
2) npm start (To Run The Application)

That's All.
